# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System  

This project is a **content-based Movie Recommendation System** built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, designed to help users discover movies similar to their favorites. It leverages the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** for metadata and enriches the experience with **movie posters and details fetched dynamically using the TMDB API**. By applying **cosine similarity** on vectorized features (genres, cast, crew, keywords, etc.), the system delivers accurate and visually engaging recommendations through a simple, interactive web app.  

The project demonstrates the complete journey of building a recommendation system: **data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity modeling, and deployment**. Beyond just functionality, it highlights how data science can be combined with real-world APIs to create a seamless user experience.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow  

1. **Introduction** â†’ Define the goal of recommending similar movies.  
2. **Dataset Collection** â†’ Use the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** for movie metadata.  
3. **Preprocessing** â†’ Clean and structure data, handle missing values, and prepare text features.  
4. **Vectorization** â†’ Convert textual and categorical metadata into numerical vectors.  
5. **Cosine Similarity** â†’ Measure similarity scores between movies.  
6. **Recommendation Function** â†’ Return the top N most similar movies.  
7. **Poster Fetching** â†’ Integrate **TMDB API** to display posters and movie details.  
8. **Streamlit Deployment** â†’ Build an interactive UI for real-time recommendations.
