# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project is an interactive **Movie Recommendation System** built with Python and Streamlit that helps users discover movies similar to their favorites in a simple and engaging way. The recommendation engine is powered by preprocessed metadata and similarity scores derived from the dataset, which are then used to generate personalized suggestions based on the selected movie. The web interface, created with Streamlit, provides a smooth and user-friendly experience where users can select a title and instantly explore recommendations without needing any technical knowledge. The repository includes two main components: `app.py`, which contains the Streamlit application code ready for local use or deployment, and `movie-recommendation-system.ipynb`, a Jupyter Notebook that documents the data preprocessing, similarity calculation, and model-building process. This setup makes the project not only functional but also easy to extend for experimenting with new algorithms, integrating additional datasets, or enhancing the user interface. To try it out, simply install the dependencies, run `streamlit run app.py`, and enjoy discovering your next favorite movie.
